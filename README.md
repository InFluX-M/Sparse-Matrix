**Features and Applications Previous Version:**
   - optimal and suitable Store for the Sparse Matrix with Linked List data structure
   - Implementation of suitable methods for inserting, deleting, updating, searching and accessing the matrix
   - Implementation Array model equivalent for Store Sparse Matrix and Implementation methods
   - Implementation simple and appropriate user interface

**New Features and Applications:** 
   - Implementation Algorithms for the shortest traverse to access the nodes in the link list with the help of Sparse Matrix Array

**In the future? :D**
Implementation Doubly Linked List for the Store for the Sparse Matrix
Implementation fastest Algorithms for the shortest path and traverse to access the nodes 
Implementation GUI user interface

**Information & Time Complexities:**

**- Class Matrix:**
   - Class Node
   - Class Linkedlist
   - Class CompactMatrix


n = Element non zero Matrix


**Access:**
  - LinkedLists -> O(n)
  - CompactMatrix -> O(Log(n))


**Insert: O(n)**
   - LinkedLists -> O(n)
   - CompactMatrix -> O(n)


**Delete: O(n)**
   - LinkedLists -> O(1) (With the help of Access)
   - CompactMatrix -> O(n)


**Update: O(n)**
   - LinkedLists -> O(1)  (With the help of Access)
   - CompactMatrix -> O(Log(n))


**Search: O(n)**
   - LinkedLists -> O(n)
